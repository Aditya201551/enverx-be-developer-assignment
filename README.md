# enverx Project Documentation

## Setting up the project

- Clone the repo.
- Switch to the development branch.
- Run `npm i` to install all the required dependencies.
- Create an`.env` file at the root of the project and add variables below.

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:UehIWSGfyAIagSiKUh1M@containers-us-west-13.railway.app:5569/enverx?schema=enverx"
ENVIRONMENT="DEVELOPMENT"
PORT=3000
```

## Running the project

- **Development mode**: run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode.
- **Production mode**: run `npm start` to create and run the build version of the project.
- Refer to `package.json` to view custom scripts.

## API Routes

- http://localhost:3000
  - `/api` (this is the root path for all APIs, as APIs should contain a prefix called `api/` )
    - [GET] `/posts?category=`: returns posts in sorted order of creation date and name and filtered by category (if specified; otherwise, it will return all the posts).
    - [GET] `/posts/:id`: returns post with the specified `id`; otherwise, it will return error 404.
    - [POST] `/post`: takes `name`, `body` and `category` in the request body and returns the created post.
      ```jsx
      // Example request body
      {
          "name": "The blog title",
          "body": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!",
          "category": "stories"
      }
      ```
    - [PUT] `/post/:id`: takes post `id` in params and data to be updated in the body of the request and returns the updated post.
      ```jsx
      //request URL
      http://localhost:3000/api/posts/:id

      //Example request body
      {
          "name": "UPDATED blog title",
      }
      ```
    - [DELETE] `post/:id`: takes post id in request parameter and returns deleted post object.

## Additional Features and Improvements

- Added type safety on the route level using `generics` on each routeâ€™s path.
- Created an error handler combining the `http-errors` module and error handler middleware to handle custom-generated errors and unexpected exceptions such as error 500.
- Added request loggers using `winston` (to create custom logs using colours) and `morgan`(to log HTTP requests with `winston`).
- Added prisma to the project for better access to DB in a `singleton pattern`.
